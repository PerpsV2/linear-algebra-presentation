                    For now, you can think of vectors as a special type of quantity which cannot be represented by just one value.<br class="large"></span>

                    The exact value of a vector varies slightly from field to field. For instance, in physics, a vector is anything with a 
                    <x-hl>magnitude</x-hl> and a <x-hl>direction</x-hl>, while in other cases, a vector can simply be thought of as a list of numbers.<br class="large"></span>

                    <span data-reveal-index="3">
                    More generally however, a vector is anything in which <em>vector addition</em> and <em>scalar multiplication</em> can be meaningfully applied to.<br class="large"></span>

                    This interpretation is most often used in physics, where the magnitude represents the strength/amount/etc. of some quantity,
