                    Recall that we've defined a vector as a quantity with a magnitude and a direction.<br>
                    This is an informal definition however, and can only take us so far.</span>

                    Like just about everything in math, generalization helps give a broader understanding of a topic as a whole. 
                    Anything we prove about vector spaces can be applied to anything which can be described as a vector space.</span>

                    In the previous section, we've already seen the standard definition of vector addition and scalar 
                    multiplication, though anything works as long as we adhere to some axioms (like the commutativity 
                    and associativity rules for addition to name a couple).</span>

                    One important thing to note is that the result of the operations must also be an
