                    Recall that we've defined a vector as a quantity with a magnitude and a direction.<br>
                    This is an informal definition however, and can only take us so far.</span>

                    <x-hl>Vector spaces</x-hl> give us a more generalized definition of a vector.</span>

                    <span data-reveal-index="4">
                    Like just about everything in math, generalization helps give a broader understanding of a topic as a whole. 
                    Anything we prove about vector spaces can be applied to anything which can be described as a vector space.</span>

                    (Subtraction and division can be omitted from the definition here as they are special cases of multiplication

                    The scalar field we've been using so far is the real number field, which contains every 'ordinary' number
                    like 3, -5, 2.2, \(\pi\), etc. Using this field creates a <em>real vector space</em>.</span>

                    Note that a vector space is <em>not</em> a field because, as stated earlier, there is no clear multiplication

                    Lastly, we need to define what vector addition and scalar multiplication will do.</span>

                    <span data-reveal-index="2">
                    In the previous section, we've already seen the standard definition of vector addition and scalar 
                    multiplication, though anything works as long as we adhere to some axioms (like the commutativity 
                    and associativity rules for addition to name a couple).</span>

                    <span data-reveal-index="3">
                    These are the called the <x-hl>vector space axioms</x-hl>, though we won't concern ourselvese too much with them.</span>

                    <span data-reveal-index="4">
                    One important thing to note though, is that the result of the operations must also be an 
                    element of the vector space.</span>
