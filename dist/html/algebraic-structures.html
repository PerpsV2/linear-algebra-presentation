                    This section is a bit different than the others as it doesn't really have anything to do with linear algebra.<br>
                    Instead, it covers <em>sets</em>, <em>binary operations</em>, and explains some key <em>algebraic structures</em> as seen in 
                    abstract algebra with an emphasis on fields.</span>

                    Knowing these other structures simplifies the explanation of <em>vector spaces</em> and is also just nice for future reference.<br>
